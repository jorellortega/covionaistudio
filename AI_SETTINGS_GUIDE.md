## Database Structure

The system uses a new `ai_settings` table:

CREATE TABLE ai_settings (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  tab_type TEXT CHECK (tab_type IN ('scripts', 'images', 'videos', 'audio')),
  locked_model TEXT NOT NULL,
  is_locked BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  UNIQUE(user_id, tab_type)
);
```
