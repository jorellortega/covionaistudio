### 4. Color Scripts
**Purpose**: Plan how color shifts across your project to guide mood and storytelling.

**What to Generate**:
- Color palettes for different scenes
- Mood-based color schemes
- Character-specific color themes
- Environmental color variations
- Emotional color progression

**Example Prompts**:
- "A warm, golden color palette for a happy family scene"
- "A cold, blue-gray palette for a mysterious nighttime sequence"
- "A vibrant, energetic color scheme for an action scene"

### 5. Lighting & Atmosphere
**Purpose**: Design how scenes feel through lighting and atmospheric effects.

**What to Generate**:
- Lighting setups and mood

**Example Prompts**:
- "Dramatic side lighting creating long shadows in a noir scene"
- "Soft, diffused lighting for a romantic evening scene"
- "Harsh, bright lighting for an interrogation room"

### 6. Style Guides & Bibles
**Purpose**: Create rulebooks for your project's visual identity and consistency.

**What to Generate**:
- Design principles and rules
- Color palette guidelines

- **Filtering**: Organize prompts by type, style, and model
- **Search**: Find prompts quickly with text search
- **Reuse**: Apply saved prompts to new generations
- **Regenerate**: Use saved prompts to create variations

## AI Integration

### Supported AI Models
1. **OpenAI DALL-E 3**: Best for high-quality, detailed images
2. **Anthropic Claude**: Best for detailed text descriptions and analysis
3. **OpenArt SDXL**: Best for artistic and stylized images

### Style Options
- **Cinematic**: Movie poster style with dramatic lighting
- **Concept**: Detailed concept art and illustrations
- **Sketch**: Rough sketches and concept development
- **Realistic**: Photorealistic and high-detail images
- **Stylized**: Unique artistic interpretations

## Best Practices

### 1. Prompt Writing
- Be specific and descriptive
- Include style, mood, and technical details
- Mention specific visual elements you want
- Use reference terms (e.g., "in the style of Studio Ghibli")

### 2. Organization
- Use descriptive titles for your generated items
- Tag items appropriately for easy searching
- Group related concepts together
- Keep a consistent naming convention

### 3. Iteration
- Generate multiple variations of the same concept
- Refine prompts based on results
- Save successful prompts for future use
- Build upon previous generations

### 4. Consistency
- Use the same style settings for related items
- Maintain consistent color schemes
- Follow established design rules
- Reference your style guide regularly

### 5. Prompt Management
- Save successful prompts for reuse
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Tag prompts with relevant categories
- Build a library of proven prompts
- Track which prompts work best for different types

## Workflow Tips

### 1. Start with Style Guides
Begin by creating a comprehensive style guide that defines your project's visual identity. This will help maintain consistency across all other elements.

### 2. Character Development Process
1. Generate character concept art
2. Create character turnarounds
3. Design costume variations
4. Develop facial expressions
5. Create pose references

### 3. Environment Development Process
1. Generate location concepts
2. Create mood boards
3. Design architectural details
4. Develop atmospheric effects
5. Create lighting setups

### 4. Integration with Other Tools
- Use generated images in your storyboards
- Reference character designs in your treatments
- Apply color scripts to your timeline
- Export style guides for your team

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Poor Image Quality**: Try different style settings or refine your prompt
2. **Inconsistent Results**: Use the same style and model settings
3. **AI Service Errors**: Check your API keys and settings
4. **Slow Generation**: Some models take longer than others

### Getting Better Results
1. **Iterate on Prompts**: Refine and improve your descriptions
2. **Use Reference Images**: Describe specific visual styles you want
3. **Combine Models**: Use different models for different purposes
4. **Save Successful Prompts**: Build a library of working prompts
