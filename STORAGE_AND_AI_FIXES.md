# Storage 403 Errors and DALL-E API Fixes

## Issues Identified

Based on your console logs, there are two main problems:

1. **Storage 403 Errors**: Images are failing to load due to restrictive storage policies
2. **DALL-E API Error**: The image generation is failing with a 500 error

## Fix 1: Storage 403 Errors

### Problem
Your Supabase storage bucket has Row Level Security (RLS) enabled with policies that restrict read access to authenticated users only. When images are displayed in the browser (via `<img>` tags), they're accessed without authentication context, causing 403 errors.

### Solution
Run the storage fix script in your Supabase SQL Editor:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard** → **SQL Editor**
2. **Copy and paste** the contents of `scripts/fix-storage-403.sql`
3. **Click Run**

This script will:
- Drop restrictive read policies
- Create a public read policy for all files
- Ensure the bucket is set to public
- Maintain security for upload/update/delete operations

### Alternative Quick Fix
If you prefer, you can manually run these commands:

```sql
-- Make bucket public
UPDATE storage.buckets SET public = true WHERE id = 'cinema_files';

-- Allow public read access
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'cinema_files');
```

## Fix 2: DALL-E API Error

### Problem
The image generation API is failing because there's a mismatch between the service calls and the actual API implementation.

### What Was Fixed
1. **Updated API Route**: Fixed the `app/api/ai/generate-image/route.ts` to use the correct services
2. **Improved Error Handling**: Better error messages and logging
3. **Service Integration**: Properly integrated with `lib/ai-services.ts`

### Verification
After the fixes, test the image generation:
1. Go to your AI Studio or image generation page
2. Try generating an image with DALL-E
3. Check the console for any remaining errors

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Test Storage Access
Run the test script in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of scripts/test-storage.sql
```

This will verify:
- ✅ Bucket is public
- ✅ Read policies are correct
- ✅ Files can be accessed
- ✅ Permissions are set correctly

### 2. Test Image Generation
1. Navigate to your image generation feature
2. Try generating an image with DALL-E
3. Check the browser console for errors
4. Verify the generated image displays properly

### 3. Test Existing Images
1. Go to a page with existing images
2. Check if the 403 errors are gone
3. Verify images load without authentication issues

## Expected Results

After applying the fixes:

- ✅ **No more 403 errors** when loading images
- ✅ **DALL-E image generation works** without 500 errors
- ✅ **Existing images display properly** in the browser
- ✅ **New image uploads work** correctly
- ✅ **Storage security maintained** for write operations

## Troubleshooting

### If Storage Still Shows 403 Errors:
1. **Clear browser cache** and hard refresh
2. **Verify bucket is public** in Supabase dashboard
3. **Check policies** are applied correctly
4. **Run the test script** to verify setup

### If DALL-E Still Fails:
1. **Check API key** is valid and has credits
2. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly
3. **Check console logs** for specific error messages
4. **Test API key** with a simple OpenAI request

### If Images Still Don't Load:
1. **Check file paths** are correct
2. **Verify bucket name** matches your code
3. **Check RLS policies** are not conflicting
4. **Test with a simple image** first

## Security Considerations

The fixes maintain security by:
- **Public read access** for image display
- **Authenticated uploads** only
- **User isolation** for file management
- **RLS enabled** for write operations

## Next Steps

1. **Apply the storage fix** in Supabase
2. **Test image loading** in your app
3. **Test image generation** with DALL-E
4. **Monitor for any new issues**
5. **Consider implementing** more granular policies if needed
