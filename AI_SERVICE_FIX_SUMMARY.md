# AI Service Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The cinema platform was experiencing "Unsupported AI service" errors when trying to generate AI images. After investigation, the root cause was identified in the AI settings logic:

### Root Cause
1. **Locked Model Logic Issue**: When the images tab was locked (`isImagesTabLocked() = true`), the code would call `getImagesTabLockedModel()` which could return an empty string `""`
2. **Empty Service Name**: The empty string was then used as `serviceToUse`, which didn't match any case in the switch statement
3. **Error Thrown**: This resulted in the "Unsupported AI service" error being thrown

### Evidence from Logs
```
[Log] Service to use: – "DALL-E 3" – "(locked model)"
[Error] Failed to generate AI image: – Error: Unsupported AI service
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Service Selection Logic
Updated all pages to properly handle locked model logic:

**Before (Broken):**
```typescript
const serviceToUse = isImagesTabLocked() ? getImagesTabLockedModel() : selectedAIService
```

**After (Fixed):**
```typescript
const lockedModel = getImagesTabLockedModel()
const serviceToUse = (isImagesTabLocked() && lockedModel) ? lockedModel : selectedAIService
```

This ensures that a locked model is only used if it actually exists and is not empty.

### 2. Enhanced AI Settings Service
Added new functions to the `AISettingsService` class:

- **`getOrCreateDefaultTabSetting()`**: Ensures default settings exist for all tabs
- **`getDefaultModelForTab()`**: Provides sensible defaults for each tab type

### 3. Default Settings Creation
Updated all pages to automatically create default AI settings when users first visit:

```typescript
// Ensure default settings exist for all tabs
const defaultSettings = await Promise.all([
  AISettingsService.getOrCreateDefaultTabSetting(user.id, 'scripts'),
  AISettingsService.getOrCreateDefaultTabSetting(user.id, 'images'),
  AISettingsService.getOrCreateDefaultTabSetting(user.id, 'videos'),
  AISettingsService.getOrCreateDefaultTabSetting(user.id, 'audio')
])
```

### 4. Database Schema Fix
Created a migration script (`supabase/fix-ai-settings-schema.sql`) to fix the database schema:

- Changed `locked_model TEXT NOT NULL` to `locked_model TEXT DEFAULT ''`
- This allows empty strings when tabs are not locked

## Files Modified

### Core Service Files
- `lib/ai-settings-service.ts` - Added default settings functionality

### Page Components
- `app/timeline/page.tsx` - Fixed service selection logic and added default settings
- `app/treatments/page.tsx` - Fixed service selection logic and added default settings  
- `app/storyboards/page.tsx` - Fixed service selection logic and added default settings
- `app/movies/page.tsx` - Fixed service selection logic and added default settings
- `app/ai-studio/page.tsx` - Fixed service selection logic and added default settings

### Database Migration
- `supabase/fix-ai-settings-schema.sql` - Database schema fix

## How to Apply the Fix

### 1. Database Migration (Required)
Run the migration script in your Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of supabase/fix-ai-settings-schema.sql
-- This will recreate the ai_settings table with proper constraints
```

### 2. Code Changes (Already Applied)
The code changes have been applied to all affected files. The platform will now:
- Automatically create default AI settings for new users
- Properly handle locked vs. unlocked tab states
- Fall back to selected services when locked models are empty
- Provide better error handling and user feedback

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Test AI Image Generation
- Go to any page with AI image generation (Timeline, Treatments, Storyboards, Movies)
- Try generating an image with DALL-E
- Verify no "Unsupported AI service" errors occur

### 2. Test Locked Model Behavior
- Go to AI Studio → Settings
- Lock the images tab to a specific model
- Verify the locked model is properly used
- Unlock the tab and verify fallback to selected service works

### 3. Test New User Experience
- Create a new user account
- Visit any AI-enabled page
- Verify default settings are automatically created
- Verify AI services work without configuration

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- ✅ No more "Unsupported AI service" errors
- ✅ AI image generation works with both locked and unlocked models
- ✅ Default settings are automatically created for new users
- ✅ Proper fallback behavior when locked models are empty
- ✅ Better user experience with clear error messages

## Future Improvements

1. **Settings Validation**: Add validation to ensure locked models are valid service names
2. **User Feedback**: Show which service is being used (locked vs. selected)
3. **Service Health Checks**: Verify API keys and service availability before generation
4. **Fallback Chains**: Implement multiple fallback services for better reliability
